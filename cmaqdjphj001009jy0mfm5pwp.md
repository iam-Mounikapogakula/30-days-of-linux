Linux is a powerful and widely used operating system, especially in DevOps and server environments. Whether you're managing servers, writing shell scripts, or troubleshooting issues, mastering Linux commands is essential. Here's a guide to the most basic and commonly used Linux commands to get you started.

When you start using Linux, it‚Äôs important to first know **who you are**, **where you are**, and then learn how to **move around** and **manage files**.

Before you start creating or managing files, you need to identify yourself and understand your current location in the system

When you're using the **Linux terminal**, the **command prompt** often shows something like this:

## 1\. Username, Hostname, and Working Directory

In the Linux terminal prompt, you often see something like:

```plaintext
username@hostname:working_directory$
```

* **username**: the name of the user currently logged in.
    
* **hostname**: the name of the computer or server.
    
* **working\_directory**: the current folder you are in.
    
* **$**: the prompt symbol indicating a regular user (for root user, it‚Äôs `#`).
    
* **Example:**
    
    ```plaintext
    mounika@inspiron:~$
    ```
    
    Here, `mounika` is the user, `inspiron` is the computer name, and `~` means the home directory.
    
    To check these yourself, you can run:
    
    * Your username:
        
        ```plaintext
        whoami
        ```
        
    * Your hostname:
        
        ```plaintext
        hostname
        ```
        
    * Your current directory:
        
        ```plaintext
        pwd
        ```
        
    
    ---
    
    ## 2\. What Does `$` Mean?
    
    * The `$` symbol at the end of the prompt means you are logged in as a **regular user** (non-root).
        
    * If you see `#`, that means you are logged in as the **root user** (administrator).
        
    
    **Example:**
    
    ```plaintext
    mounika@inspiron:~$  (regular user)
    root@inspiron:~#  (root user)
    ```

## üìÇ 2. Navigate Through Directories

Linux is like a big tree of folders. You need to learn how to move between these folders.

### üëâ This is Syntax: `ls`

### üëâ This is Structure: Lists files and folders in the current directory.

üëâ This is Syntax: `cd foldername`

üëâ This is Structure: Changes into the folder called `foldername`.

### üëâ This is Syntax: `cd ..`

üëâ This is Structure: Goes back one level to the parent directory.

### üëâ This is Syntax: `cd ~`

üëâ This is Structure: Goes to your home directory.

## üìÑ 3. Create and View Files

Now that you know where you are, let‚Äôs start making and reading files.

### üìÑ How to Create Files in Linux: All Ways Explained with Examples

| Method | Command Example | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `touch` | `touch file.txt` | Create empty file |
| `echo` | `echo "text" > file.txt` | Create file with single line text |
| `cat` | `cat > file.txt` + Ctrl+D | Create file with multiple lines input |
| `printf` | `printf "line1\nline2\n" > file.txt` | Create file with formatted content |
| Text Editors | `nano file.txt` or `vim file.txt` | Create and edit file interactively |

### 1\. Using `touch` command

* **Purpose:** Creates an empty file or updates the timestamp of an existing file.
    
* **Syntax:**
    
    ```plaintext
    touch filename.txt
    ```
    
* **Example:**
    
    ```plaintext
    touch myfile.txt
    ```
    
    Creates an empty file called `myfile.txt` if it doesn't exist.
    

### üëâ This is Syntax: `touch filename.txt`

### 2\. Using `echo` command

* **Purpose:** Create a file and add some text content to it.
    
* **Syntax:**
    
    ```plaintext
    echo "Your text here" > filename.txt
    ```
    
* **Example:**
    
    ```plaintext
    echo "Hello Linux!" > greetings.txt
    ```
    
    Creates `greetings.txt` with the content `Hello Linux!`.
    
* **Note:**  
    Using `>` will overwrite the file if it exists. Use `>>` to append text.
    

---

### 3\. Using `cat` command

* **Purpose:** Create a file and enter multiple lines manually.
    
* **Syntax:**
    
    ```plaintext
    cat > filename.txt
    ```
    
    Then type text, and press `Ctrl + D` to save and exit.
    
* **Example:**
    
    ```plaintext
    cat > notes.txt
    ```
    
    Then type:
    
    ```plaintext
    This is my first note.
    This is the second line.
    ```
    
    Press `Ctrl + D` when done.
    

---

### 4\. Using `printf` command

* **Purpose:** Create a file with formatted content.
    
* **Syntax:**
    
    ```plaintext
    printf "Line1\nLine2\n" > filename.txt
    ```
    
* **Example:**
    
    ```plaintext
    printf "Hello\nWorld\n" > hello.txt
    ```
    
    Creates `hello.txt` with two lines:
    
    ```plaintext
    Hello
    World
    ```
    

---

### 5\. Using text editors

* **Purpose:** Create and edit files interactively.
    
* **Common editors:**
    
    * `nano filename.txt` ‚Äî Easy-to-use text editor.
        
    * `vim filename.txt` ‚Äî Powerful but advanced editor.
        
* **Example with nano:**
    
    ```plaintext
    nano myfile.txt
    ```
    
    This opens the nano editor where you can write content, then save (`Ctrl + O`) and exit (`Ctrl + X`).

    * **Example:**
        
        ```plaintext
        mkdir projects
        ```
        
        Creates a new directory named `projects`.
        
    * **Create multiple directories at once:**
        
        ```plaintext
        mkdir dir1 dir2 dir3
        ```
        
    * **Create parent directories as needed:**
        
        ```plaintext
        mkdir -p parent/child/grandchild
        ```
        
        Creates the full nested directory structure even if the parents don‚Äôt exist.

        * `cd ..` ‚Üí Move up one directory (to parent directory)
            
        * `cd ~` or simply `cd` ‚Üí Go to your home directory
            
        * `cd -` ‚Üí Switch back to the previous directory
            
    
    ---
    
    ### 3\. **List Directory Contents:** `ls`
    
    * **Syntax:**
        
        ```plaintext
        ls [options] [directory]
        ```
        
    * **Example:**
        
        ```plaintext
        ls
        ```
        
        Lists files and folders in the current directory.
        
    * **Common options:**

        ```
        
    * **Remove directory with files inside:**
        
        ```plaintext
        rm -r directory_name
        ```
        
        Use `-r` (recursive) to delete directory and its contents.
        
    * **Force remove without prompt:**
        
        ```plaintext
        rm -rf directory_name
        ```
        
        Be very careful! This deletes directory and everything inside without confirmation.
